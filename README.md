# ProcessingGame

An untitled game being developed in the Java based Processing programming language. A 3-player game, players control tanks while trying to defeat the opposing team. A single player must combat a team of two handicapped players. At the moment the game is played purely on a network, the player in the team of one will act as the server while the players in the team of two act as the clients.

Will potentially be fully converted to java at a later time.


TODO:

2. Background graphic
3. Classes? So the team of two do not play exactly the same.
4. Brainstorm

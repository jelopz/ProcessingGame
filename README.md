# ProcessingGame

A currently untitled game being developed in the Java based Processing programming language.

Will potentially be fully converted to java at a later time.

For now, the Server class acts as Player 1 and the Client class acts as Player 2.

Known bugs:

1. For some reason, when any player moves into the top left corner they take a single hit of damage. This only happens once per execution of the game. Does not reset in a new match as long as program did not exit and reload.

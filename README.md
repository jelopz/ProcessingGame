# ProcessingGame

A currently untitled game being developed in the Java based Processing programming language.

Will potentially be fully converted to java at a later time.

For now, the Server class acts as Player 1 and the Client class acts as Player 2.

TODO:

1. Wait for all 3 players to hit S before restarting.
2. Show flare on all 3 screens
3. Graphics
3. More classes? Check out Evolve for more potential ideas.
4. Brainstorm

Known bugs:

1. When any player moves into the top left corner they take a single hit of damage. This only happens once per execution of the game. Does not reset in a new match as long as program did not exit and reload. NOT SURE IF STILL AN ISSUE

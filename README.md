# ProcessingGame

A currently untitled game being developed in the Java based Processing programming language.

Will potentially be fully converted to java at a later time.

For now, the Server class acts as Player 1 and the Client class acts as Player 2.

TODO:

1. Add a third player.   - One all knowing player vs team of 2
2. Add extra functionality to team of 2.

  a) Wards/flairs that light up a portion of the screen. This lets you know where the oppenent is or is not.
    
  b) Maybe one person has a more powerful machinegun while the other has the ability to heal.
3. More classes? Check out Evolve for more potential ideas.

Known bugs:

1. When any player moves into the top left corner they take a single hit of damage. This only happens once per execution of the game. Does not reset in a new match as long as program did not exit and reload.
